# authentication-system-django

security is the higest priority,thas why I developed an authentication system in django ,it contains the following features,

 Custom user registration,
 Email verification (A verification link will be sent to the given mail id  ),
 Change password option,
 Reset password(A password reset link will be sent to the registered mail id),

This authentication system is done by using python, django, html,css and sqlite database.
